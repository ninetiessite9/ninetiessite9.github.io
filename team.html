              <h3>Jake Wiens</h3>
              <p>Hello! I’m Jacob, but usually I go by Jake. I’ve always been working on computers since I first got one back when I was about 9 years old. Since then, I’ve learned all about the hardware that makes them work up to the complicated software that runs on every application that runs on a computer. I’ve always had fun using Social Media websites since I was a teenager and as the years have went by, I felt like the customization has gone as well. That’s why I’ve begun working with our team on making this new Social Media that will bring back some of the great things about the old web.</p>

              <p>Hey I’m Brett and I’m a Computer Science student. You can usually find me at King Coffee here in Tempe working on mobile apps, but I’m excited to get into the world of web development with our take on a social media website.</p>

              <h3>Jacob Smith</h3>
              <p>I’m Jacob Smith, and I’m a 3rd year student at ASU and I'm looking to get a degree in informatics. I'm a big fan of internet culture and vintage computers and I feel I'm an expert on A E S T H E T I C S, I’m a resident expert among my friends on vaporwave and future funk and I fondly remember logging on to the web back when I was younger, and using myspace back in it’s hayday and I’d love to bring back that feeling of adventure, and the ability to use a social media site that could be made truly your own. I’m hoping to bring all that together and do my part in making our website stand out in the sea of bland and boring social networks.
